Utilizing AI for the prediction and prevention of Dementia.   [insert_url_here]



# What's it all about?

The Goal: Create an app and website that fully harnesses AI as a tool in the fight against Dementia. We must help people understand how likely they are to develop Dementia and what factors contribute to that risk. Then, we will provide them with individualized feedback and resources for prevention or mitigation. 

It also wouldn't hurt to make it fun to use. ðŸ˜‰


The Team: Lori Langdon, Will Morgan, Ross Carvalho, Kaanjaree Nune, Vishwa Reddy, Hanane Abkar, Christopher Williams.


The Audience: Anyone who is concerned about Dementia and wants to prevent or mitigate it, whether it be for themselves or for a loved one.
